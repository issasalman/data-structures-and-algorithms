## Approach & Efficiency

The Efficiency of the Big O time is O(nlogn)

The Efficiency of the Big O space is O(1)

## Solution

for the solution, you just need to insert any numeric array, and the quick_sort will check if left less than right and call partition function , Partition will assign pivot and compare it with other   numbers  and swap functions will sort the array,
