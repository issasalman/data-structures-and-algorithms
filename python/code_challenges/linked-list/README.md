## Challenge
its a challenge to make Linked list and start adding nodes that has a value and points to the next node and last node points to None

## Approach & Efficiency
The Efficiency of Big O is O(n)

## API
We have 3 methods
1- append method : that used to add new node to the linked lists
2- search method: that used to search for specific values in the linked list
3- str method: to give a presenting way to the user when he prints the object after adding values for example
4- counter method : to count how many times we added a value
